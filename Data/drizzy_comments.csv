1.0,"I'm not as huge a fan of KSG as some of you, but ya'll massively overrate it because of Fantano, and it seems like none of you will ever change your mind on that, so I'll leave it be. 

But Views (and even More Life) are better than both Ye and Tlop imo. Ye seemed like a bunch of demos, and TLop was a constantly edited album, Kanye just wasn't putting in his best effort in these. I still enjoyed both of them somewhat, but Views is just a complete album, it's solid. 

All the way till MBDTF and Watch the Throne, Kanye was putting in his full effort, he was actually trying. After that, he started to focus on other stuff, fashion, his brand, etc. And unfortunately, the music did take a hit. Doesn't mean the music is always bad since then, but it's just not as enjoyable. Kanye is one of my favorite artists all time, but it doesn't mean we just ignore when the effort just isn't there.",WhenItsHalfPastFive,1626734296,Drizzy

As such, he’s just really making the same type of music like he’s found a formula that works and sells and poof thats it. Not saying that his music is bad or anything but its really not experimental. Compared to Kanye’s albums which are always different from the rest.

There is a VAST difference in attention to detail production wise from MBDTF or graduation compared to his recent releases (KSG, Daytona, Ye, Jesus is King..... I could go on). Life of Pablo was his most recent decent release, but I'd argue we could see the steep drop off after Watch the Throne. Some really like Yeezus, personally I don't outside of a couple joints.

It felt forced as fuck and I honestly don’t think there’s one track on that shit that’s actually good. what’s even more hilarious to me is how fans will defend it til the fucking end, like how do you let a guy like Kanye get away with that shit?

Drake been consistently putting up the best numbers for ten fucking years lmao. Resulting in an artist of the decade award that Tyler the Creator will never get, Kanye will never get, Lil Baby will never get, because nobody puts out quality music like Drake, as consistently as Drake. He’s literally progressed as an artist, tapping into new genres and styles every other year and getting bigger in popularity and fame and breaking new records left and right. I’ve never seen an artist break his own records like Drake does. This guy is in another stratosphere compared to everyone else currently. 

It’s obvious you just personally dislike the guy, and that’s fine, but don’t downplay his accomplishments, achievements and status.

Kids of today see Kanye as mostly a meme, he’s had way too much smoke regarding his mental illness, Trump shit, his divorce, his crazy rants on Twitter, his recent music having polarizing reception. He is absolutely in a decline. The same CANNOT be said about Drake who’s only bigger and better than he was four or five years ago. And Drake is 10 YEARS younger

All I’m saying is we’re seeing other artists in his era progress and grow. Listen to Tyler’s new album and tell me Drake has put that level of work into curating a project for the past few years. The production, themes, and way he weaved the features throughout the songs. When talking about defining great artists this sub likes focusing solely on numbers, like Lil Nas X isn’t putting out bs and getting numbers. There has to be some growth, creativity, and willingness to step out of that comfort zone.

,"Well while the Ye fan boys can dispute the arena this has been asked in, the fact of the matter Ye is out of his prime. He has been for some time. Drake has only had brief pauses. And say what you will about Drakes latest working going backwards, but he churns out hits like no other artist before him that wasn’t a traditional pop star.

To me Drake was inevitable. It was only a matter of time before the two Genres that often joined together found someone who could do both.

We needed a rapper with timing, and a good voice. You got the best version of that with Drake. Tell me someone who can honestly say they didn’t see this coming....

Daniel Glover is too eccentric and his voice isn’t as good as Drake. Drake is more tapped into what makes Pop. The mainstream. Big Sean has a good voice but not as good as Drake. Drake frankly is a better rapper and has better beats and better hooks than Sean as well.

And the Traditional other side of the ball, the Lyrisists are quick to try to discredit Drake for Authenticity because he did something they couldn’t. They do not have the ability to go Pop like Drake did.

Kendrick and Wayne do not have the voice.

Both tried and succeeded FAR PAST THEIR ABILITIES. Both are genius’s. Both are all time greats and better rappers. 

Kendrick even took over Drakes fame for a very small window when they attacked Drake with a 3 year setup and plan. But Kendrick wasnt the only moving piece. Kendrick couldn’t do it by himself. He needed help. And he didn’t get it.

Damn. Beat More Life and beat the brakes off it. 

Hence Kendrick’s victory lap on Drake with the remix of Mask Off. Read the lyrics. Get it? If you don’t read them again.

But that was a fleeting moment in 2017 that got buried by 18. Drake back, drake took over the game. Dropped what many think was a mediocre record. Drake wasn’t even proud of it.

BUT: Gods Plan, In my Feelings, Nice For What, Non Stop, I’m Upset, Mob Ties, and even a song with Michael Jackson - It don’t Matter to me. 

Drake had 1’s BUSTING OUT THE PLASTIC AGAIN LIKE VIEWS.

A 3.5 year plan by the industry failed to take down Drake.

Team Red planned to take him down, Kendrick specifically disappeared after Pimp to a Butterfly.

Kendrick was the Pulitzer Prize, two album in the top 10 all time rap albums wasn’t enough. The critical acclaim maybe most ever, wasn’t enough.

Meanwhile Drake was upset and wanted his critical success he feel he hasn’t gotten and deserved from Nothing Was the Same and Take Care.

Both wanted what the other had. Kendrick took 3.5 years. Changed his style. Tried to go creative Pop. He leaned into that weird voice. A smart move.

First illustrated on Travis Scott’s Goosebumps a Mega Hit. That was a banger,

The weird voice was a break out success. No one knew how big that was for Red teams plan. A plan flawlessly executed to break down the VOICE. 

Damn. Was an all time Classic. He did it. He went Pop while not compromising his integrity but it didn’t matter. It was only a small moment.

And Drake didn’t ever get his credit.

It will be forever unfinished and neither will ever be satisfied. Because neither has the ability to eclipse the others skill in their genre. 

Advise: Both are bigger than the game. Two of the greats that transcend the Sport (the music). Be happy with what you are. 

Lesson for everybody. No matter what you have, you are never happy you always want more. Appreciate the success.",The_Lyric_God,1626668428,Drizzy

,"I don't think any of those two songs would be the lead single. Not Around and Fair Trade both sound like hit songs, but both are already kinda known. Especially Fair Trade.

If it would be any of those two it's probably gonna be Not Around. Not Around is a song that would do very well in clubs or parties. Also, it's more of a repetitive song, so hit wise it would probably be less lasting than Fair Trade on the charts.

It's a bit like when he dropped I'm Upset before he dropped Scorpion. I honestly feel like he chose that song, because he knew it was gonna do good numbers and do well in clubs/parties etc, but wouldn't last long as a hit. But long enough to drop Scorpion right when the song starts dropping on the charts. 

Fair Trade would probably last longer on the charts. It puts you right in your feels, very catchy, and has an iconic one liner.

To answer your question, Drake would've had to go to very low levels to beat pusha in that beef. If he did, it would've darkened his legacy a bit in my opinion. Word was Drake had ammo that would've blown up a lot of shit. I'm not sure how much I believe it, but mans played it safe and it definitely paid off long term.",Chezzworth,1626441509,Drizzy

,"I’m not familiar with French Montana. I only liked a few of his mid career releases, That one song with The Weeknd, and laughing when he comes up on a track.

I am pretty familiar with Kendrick.

I could say Kendrick has at least 1 club’ish song per album. Probably a few features too. Kendrick releases music in a surgical way. Every album he puts out is certified goat material.

I just checked French Montana’s Apple Music. I had to do a little scroll through his ‘albums.’ God damn that guy has put out so much fucking music. It’s like he just blasts a shotgun at his fans,”hope you fuckers like this.” So many features… etc.

French has like 1 or 2 “hits” MAYBE club hits. Maybe. We all know club hits come and go quickly. They’re a dime a dozen imo.",stuckInForLoop,1626439861,Drizzy

,"It incentivizes people to use the other streaming platforms where the royalties are probably higher. Given that YouTube is very strict that you can’t get money from it unless everything in the song is completely original, and given that Drake is one of many hip hop artists that uses a lot of samples, I would estimate he isn’t making any money from putting his music on YouTube. It’s put in YouTube simply for the fans and marketability but he knows fans can also go to other streaming services so it’s a balancing act. Put it on YouTube so that they can get a taste but not keep it on there so they are too comfortable listening to it on YouTube.",syrophoenician,1626369412,Drizzy

I have also seen that he alternates between which albums he puts on YouTube. One week it may be Views on there and then the next week Views won’t be available and More Life will be available. And that goes for his entire discography. I kindly disagree that the songs are being remastered.

They’re fighting for digital real estate and it would just make no sense to put Drake and Taylor out at the same time as it would give them a fraction of the promo if they have to share the date. Everyone’s core fanbase is gonna support who they want but the real difference comes from which casual fans you can rope in with extra marketing.

,"In case he never puts in the song out for streaming. You can add the song to your spotify on PC. It's a bit of a tackle, but if you have spotify on PC, you can do the following.

1. Open Spotify
2. Go to settings  (Top right, Your Username  --&gt; Settings )
3. Enable Local Files
4. Show songs from any desired folder
5. Put Not Around.mp3 in that folder
6. Go to your library
7. Go to local files (Right next to the songs you like)
8. Add the Not Around to any playlist
9. Download playlist on phone while on the same wifi connection
10. Profit?

If you want to add the song to the songs you like, you gotta play the song on your phone and add it through your phone because somehow you can't do that on PC. This goes with deleting it from your songs you like as well. I really hope this helps out, because playing the song on iphone files is the worst fucking thing. This is how I got all of Drake's leaked songs on my spotify on my phone.

If by any chance I wasted my time because you don't use spotify but Apple Music. You can add mp3 files to your Apple Music on pc or macos as well, but I don't remember the steps for that one.",TacoHaven,1626288127,Drizzy

Drake told SupahMario it was for sure going on the album but he decided to capitalize off the hype when it leaked. I do believe that he intended for Scary Hours 2 to be the same type of release as the first one. ""Wants &amp; Needs"" as the single (like ""God's Plan"") &amp; a bar record (like ""Diplomatic Immunity"", ""Lemon Pepper Freestyle"". Due to the buzz that was building around ""What's Next"" he went ahead and included it so that it could still have a strong commercial impact. Obviously ""Wants &amp; Needs"" wasn't necessarily a massive hit which is what most likely caused the April date to get pushed back. Drake is not going to want to drop the album or go on tour unless he has another smash. Like lets be real, ending a concert with ""LNCL"" or ""Wants &amp; Needs"" wouldn't be as momentous as ending the night with ""God's Plan"" on his last tour.",LOTTASMOKENDESEWOODS,1626271069,Drizzy

Considering the hype around it I don't think he'd keep it vaulted if he wasn't planning on having it on the album. Drake probably makes 100+ songs during an album process, especially when he's been working on it for 2-3 years. There's definitely going to be certain songs he's been holding from the jump due to how it contributes to the album in it's entirety.

He is a pretty steady presence with or without a yearly album. I think there is a very good chance that CLB is going to be worth the wait and anticipation…maybe that’s just the optimist in me but Drake rarely fumbles IMO and this is either longest, or one of the longest, that he’s gone without releasing an album so I think he worked meticulously to make it soemthing that he knows will be worth the wait.

This is only as correct as calling her the Queen of London or Queen of Hull; she is the Queen of the place that these places are in, but the title doesn't exist.

Just because I don’t like it doesn’t mean the people are wrong.

For Travis specifically I’d think it was a reflection of his audience growing bigger just like you said.

But for established artists, that doesn’t really apply. Like kanye has been a tier one artists in terms of fame for years. So his albums sales decreasing reflects the lowered quality.

Just like J cole got Lower sales on for your eyes only but higher on other modern albums of his.",CaptainJamaica,1626220552,Drizzy

Talk Up feat. Jay Z (if you’re gonna have Jay on the track, you better give that Light Up or Pound Cake energy and Drake did a pretty poor job compared to Jay)

Rachet Happy Birthday (like seriously, Drake don’t need no Travis Scott autotune to make a song sound good, so why was he trying it) 🤦🏻‍♂️

I’ll tell you what though, he is absolutely the most popular artist that the World has had in a long time. Like let’s also give Drake credit for his accomplishments, he has kinda recreated a Michael Jackson music type of presence combined with he fact that he is the on top of the most popular genre(s) right now, R&amp;B/Rap.

Drake deserves all the credit that he gets he’s an increible artist. And it is very impressive that, and this is my opinion, that Drake the Celebrity has transcended Drake the artist. Like I know sooooooooooooo many people that don’t listen to him regularly but know about him just as a celebrity. That’s a key to his success I think a little bit.

Still hard, you could say imagine how big the Beatles would’ve been with streaming etc but you can’t imagine it because it’s like a shoulda woulda coulda situation. Drake wouldn’t have done as well back in the 70s but the Beatles if they still made music today wouldn’t be as popular as Drake is today.

The Beatles did something that rarely can be replicated. There have been artists and bands since that have had their own “run” but none that have had the longevity and legendary impact as The Beatles.

The fact that we are even discussing The Beatles almost 60 years since “beatlemania” is really just giving more fuel to the fact that they have found a way to transcend popularity and time. 

And I am really not hating on Drake at all here, again I just thing we are comparing such diffrent artists/bands. And Drake has a lot more advantages of being able to spread his music quickly with streaming and social media. It’s not a knock against him, he’s just using the tools that are at his disposal! But it is undoubtedly impressive when you realize the few tools/services The Beatles were working with in comparison.

Totally respect everyone and anyone’s opinions, I mean there are certain facts that are indisputable, but everyone loves what they love and there shouldn’t be any issue with that regardless of what it is.

Like Drake may not have had an impact like the Beatles, but how many artist/bands can really claim to be even close to that level? Really none. The Beatles are a special thing and they undoubtedly had a major impact on music as a whole. 

While Drake maybe hasn’t done that with the ENTIRE music industry overall, I think he has absolutely had a “beatles-ish” impact on Rap/R&amp;B/Pop, which just so happen to be the more popular genres right now…which goes back to what I was originally saying, most of this “impact” is a product of the situation and times. 

And to defend the Beatles a little bit, Drake IS breaking Beatles records but imagine if the Beatles had all these streaming opportunities?!

Meanwhile most people from this generation don't even listen to or appreciate artists of that time/genre. Idk I just never think it's worth comparing artists because it's been proven that everyone will always ride for what they listened to as they were growing up.

My unpopular Drake opinion is that Scorpion is a top 3 Drake project. Great rapping, his best singing tracks to date, stacked with hits, and really speaks to where he was at in his career and all of the things he was dealing with. I embrace the fact that it's a double album so I don't consider it bloated and I really feel that his songwriting hit a peak at that time.",tc4050,1626211355,Drizzy

This is why I hate people saying it should have been cut down. Cause the 5 songs you cut are songs someone else really likes.


I think what drake did wrong for scorpion and views was releasing all the hit songs months early.

It made them feel separate from the album.

It felt like in my feelings was the only hit on Scorpion when that album had so many.",CaptainJamaica,1626211341,Drizzy

Album is very versatile and any Drake fan listens to different music. We've got popheads who mostly only listen to songs like God's Plan and In My Feelings. There is me who thinks that Ratchet Happy Birthday is one of Drake's worst songs ever, but there are others who really enjoy that songs. I don't think the album has a filler, but if it does it's 

1. Elevate
2. Talk Up
3. Is There More
4. Summer Games
5. Ratchet Happy Birthday (I really tried, I can not get myself to enjoy this song)
6. That's How You Feel

Also special mention to the songs that I really did enjoy

1. Emotionless
2. God's Plan
3. Mob Ties
4. Jaded
5. Nice For What

,"You bout to get mad hate for this lol. But it’s all subjective. There’s no right or wrong when it comes to the list because everyone has different tastes, viewpoints and criterias. I think, in retrospect, Drake could’ve handled that situation a lot better. But let’s be very clear. His pen game is impeccable and right up there with the greats. When he’s really rapping, real niggas know it’s legit. If it was such a big deal about QM, then a lot of lyrical rappers wouldn’t have worked with Drake post-IYRTITL. But they do and he’s still highly revered as a rapper. I truly think the QM situation was for Drake to help him, since 1da was working with him. So they co-wrote a couple songs and I think Drake’s versions are the real “references” because his vocals are pretty raw and less polished compared to his previous work. Quentin just sounds so unnatural on his versions, so since they didn’t want to leave him high and dry, Drake credited him for his contributions. The whole ghostwriting shit just got blown up outta proportion.",OwlCommission,1626031443,Drizzy

It scrapes July, so will def count in the minds of people as a summer album, which I think is what he wants, to dominate from summer till the end of the year. If not, maybe September to come full circle with his 3rd studio album Nothing Was the Same, or October in honor of OVO and his son. This 6th studio album means a lot to the 6 God, so it’s release must bear some kinda symbolic connection to him. 29, 9th month, or 10th month. Maybe August though, who knows.

It was intended to be on the album, SupahMario confirmed that, but after it leaked Drake didn’t want to lose the opportunity for the song to be a hit so he went ahead &amp; finished it. I’m almost 100% sure that Scary Hours 2 was supposed to just be “Wants &amp; Needs” &amp; “Lemon Pepper Freestyle”. A single &amp; a bar song just like he did the first time. The leak of “What’s Next” was going crazy so he capitalized off the hype surrounding it. Also I really think it was just coincidental that Lucky Lefty leaked at that time, lol.

And I would anyways prefer a complete album rollout whenever he’s ready with all the right videos, interviews, tour, promotion and everything, versus the album Cole dropped and him barely doing shit to promote it due to Covid. Felt it was the weakest Cole album since his debut.

,"Yeah, but they’ve been at each others necks for almost a decade straight now. And if you think about any great legacy, the gunning for greatness of, a say, Michael Jordan-esque status, eventually, someone must come out on top and take that W, period point blank. I need to make a video of their entire history and back to back subs at each other, cuz it’s extensive and fascinating, and I think I’ve caught almost all of it. But point is, in theory, and since we did hear it from DJ Akademics as a rumor at one point in time lending some possible credence, it would make sense for Drake to hold back and wait to see what Kendrick has, then split his head open by dropping CLB right after (that is, assuming CLB will not flop sales wise or critically, or that it would match or defeat Kendricks latest piece of work, I personally think it would however), similar to how TPAB came right after IYRTITL, or Damn came right after More Life. Not saying it’s what’s happening, but it wouldn’t surprise me. Their two camps had an obvious falling out, and Drake will make sure to make a point with his 6th album, especially on an imminent Kendrick drop. And it would t surprise me if Kendrick has actually been waiting on Drake in the same way. They both want the same title. We’ll see though. Now, here’s a throwback. Maybe Drakes first sub at Kendrick, in response to the Control Verse. Simple, but lands hard and hits hard.

,"Her most recent album is evermore, the one I’m referring to that did like300-400k, the one before that was folklore. And it did do 1.3 million, but that is globally. Lol usually when we refer to first week sales we are talking US numbers like billboard charts, hence the ~800k. Also Taylor swift is a full blown pop star. Drake is still a rapper at heart. What is impressive about drakes numbers is the fact that he is able to do pop star numbers while being a rapper. With that being said I HIGHLY doubt we will see 1.2 million but hey, I’d love to see it and I’m open to being wrong lol",Fabulous-Fun-3819,1625692235,Drizzy

I remember this vividly because blogs kept talking it &amp; then trying to bring Scooter Braun into it saying that even though he’s tried to basically shit on her, she still overcame it. The sales are definitely going to be different going forward due to rule changes etc, but if Drake can sell 110k first week on a 3 song surprise EP no promo (scary hours) just imagine an album.

These kind of things project his image &amp; give him a really refined look. It then converts over to the music &amp; hes 100% running music right now.

," What's Next was a nice turn-up song. SH2 was meant to hold people down for the album. None of those songs were expected to stay on the charts for weeks. What's Next has the Carti sound to it and even though, that sound is popular in hip hop. The general public doesn't mess with it that much. 

The charts right now are mostly focused on songs that are poppier sounding. Look at Butter &amp; Good 4 U. Seeing Green, Lemon Pepper and the other features he's done aren't meant to stick on the charts. He's not dropping cause he's worried. I think he's not dropping because of touring and wanting to have a full rollout. 

Drake doesn't do two-three week rollouts like Cole, Baby &amp; Durk, or Tyler. His rollouts are longer. Take Care rollout started in May 2011 and the album came out in November. NWTS started in February 2013 and the album came out in September. Views' lead single dropped in July 2015 and the album came out in 2016.

1. Dilemma is bigger than any song Drake has ever put out.
2. They are constantly being compared because, like Drake, Nelly is a rapper that was a *good* singer too (none of that irritating Young Thug shit)
3. *Drake is still better and is more important to Hip Hop history than Nelly.*

Some of y’all need to grow up. No need to argue with or downvote those stating facts.  Just because Dilemma, Nellyville and Country Grammar are bigger albums and songs, doesn’t mean that Nelly is better. Nor is it an indictment on Drake.

A lot of artists (Kanye, most notably) are using Carti as a feature on their upcoming albums because the dude has a really experimental and versatile voice. You can see the contrasts in @MEH and Stop Breathing. 

As much as Carti gets flak for being a mumble rapper and ruining Pain 1993, he’s as genre-pushing as they come.

Just last year we saw him seriously training to learn boxing. This year he's become even bulkier than we have probably ever seen before.

Furthermore, I think Drake likes to do shows that are personable for the fans. Rappers like kanye, travis, use a bunch of set pieces and effects to get by. Recently, Drake did a deal to open up a new venue called HISTORY in Toronto with limited attendance. The whole point is to give fans a personable experience so I think he'll continue to make that his goal.

Finally, based on my own theorizing, I think effects would take away from Drake's music because it's all based on his life.",TerribleSolid4811,1625435880,Drizzy

,"There's definitely some truth to this. I feel like Drake isn't dominating the way he once did and I'm sure he's aware of that. With that being said, my hope is that the lack of success his singles and features have been seeing is pushing him to make new and better music. I think he thought he could just put out a pretty easy song like What's Next and have it dominate, and it didn't. Hopefully he realizes that to stay on top he needs to do new things and surprise people a bit. Every massive hit of his (maybe with the exception of God's Plan) has been pretty left-field genre-wise. It's his ability to make something catchy out of any style that I think makes him special and made him one of the biggest stars in the world, and not just a big rapper.",tc4050,1625399754,Drizzy

,"Coming from the ""your top 5 Drake songs"" thread. I had Lose You at number one and it's only one I don't debate. My other top 4 can and will change. Lose you is incredibly self analytical. Drake usually gives us insight in his songs, sometimes it's a line or two between flexes, sometimes it's more specific like the songs he wrote for his mother and his dad. Lose You feels so different to me. I don't wanna get too deep, I don't know how to analyze and criticize music well. The song just hits entirely different for me. Then there's my favorite Drake line ever, had me pause the song and think to myself for a while.

,"This whole verse is amazing: 

Winnin' is problematic
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'
Not when you have it
Way less support from my peers
In recent years as I get established
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage
Why is my struggle different than others'?
Only child that's takin' care of his mother
As health worsens and bills double
That's not respectable all of a sudden?
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?
What do you see when you see me?
When did all the things I mean
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?
Maybe I share it with too many people
Back then it used to just feel like our secret
Back when I would write
And not think about how they receive it
I be tryna manifest the things I needed
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all
How they go from not wantin' me at all
To wantin' to see me lose it all?
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'
I'm overcome with emotions
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra
I could only speak what I know of
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'
And puttin' your trust in someone
With the risk of financially sinkin'
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies
Ego strokin', picture postin'
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only
But you just had to show me
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely
I know when someone lyin'
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet

,"I see what you’re saying but I didn’t want to get to deep into it because I didn’t want to seem like I was dissing Drake in a Drake subreddit. 

However, I think there is a bit of difference between the 2. Jazz, like blues and funk, is an integral part of why hip hop sounds the way it does. Many classic albums are built upon jazz soundscapes so the idea that Kendrick would do that as a hip hop artist is not being a culture vulture as the tweet suggests. He’s paying direct homage to the music (TPAB also had heavy funk influences) Jazz was performed throughout this country and is not limited to a region in the way Country music is. We are much more likely to pull a jazz musician out of New York than the next banjo playing country star. 

Where I give Drake a pass with his Toronto-based Caribbean influence, others see him as being a fraud because Aubrey is making a choice to speak this way. Theres this idea that he’s not really from those streets and he himself isn’t Caribbean and therefore he is an active participant in culture appropriation. 

Kendrick and Drake both use influences that they are not directly from however Kendrick’s a matter of style whereas Drake is a matter of identity. Its not Drake just simply making Caribbean influenced music but he changes his behavior to match that in certain company and it rubs people the wrong way. I love the “more chune for your head tops” at the award show but we know it’s more of a put-on than who he actually is.",BrandonGrotesque,1625326748,Drizzy

,Thanks. I think it makes it pretty obvious what type of Drake song I like best. My two favourite types of tracks from him are the ones where he’s either angry/aggressive rapping or introspective rapping where he paints a picture with his words and talks about his life in a deep manner.

“10 years in and y’all yet to hear my most impressive verses” - Gold Roses ft. Drake - 2019.

Face it, Drake still has many more projects and albums in him, many more features, many more records to break, many more years to dominate. 

I’m confident not one person in the music industry can surpass him. They all not impressive or versatile enough and don’t have the longevity that he has.

I've never even considered the fact that Drake is Jewish in any of these convos. I initially thought that he was just getting with the island flow because of Rihanna's influence. Then I read more and realized how influential Caribbean culture is in Toronto, and it made more sense. 

Either way, I think comparing kendrick and jazz and drake and Caribbean culture is kinda off. Kendrick didn't just pick up an accent over time. That's the part that made it kind of corny for me on drakes case. Either way, that album was dope and drake can't lose, so who gives a shit if me and other randoms on the internet complain lol.",toughinitout,1625252567,Drizzy

,"This is asked on here like every month. If you watched Rap Radar interview Drake describes his entire career and says he’s excited to go on another run for the next decade. There aren’t many artists as hungry and consistent as Drake, he will still run the game for many years. Weston Road Flows was probably recorded in 2015. Maybe back then that’s how he saw things, but it’s very evident that isn’t the case anymore. 

Besides, if CLB was Drake’s last project we’d know about it. Just recently in 2019 on the track Gold Roses he said “Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses” 

However, I do think Drake will be taking long breaks between CLB and future albums. I can see him dropping a Care Package / DLDT project in 2022. And WATTBA v.2 + the Rick Ross x Drake mixtape they’ve been teasing. There’s already more projects to look forward to beyond CLB.",ysf02,1625251141,Drizzy

,"Personally, I think he's been killing the features except for a few forgettable ones (ie. Mr. Right now w/ 21 Savage) but he was in his birkin with wasting time. I'm really not sure what people are expecting anymore whenever drake drops anything lol. It's almost like every drop is supposed to make as big of an impact as God's plan or people won't be satisfied. People just have to understand that his fan base is so large every drop can no longer cater to everyone except for those that really just fuck with drake music. I can't think of anyone else in the game that could've fit into wasting time better than drake did.",Fabulous-Fun-3819,1625105734,Drizzy

,"Something tells me it’s calculated. I feel like he could definitely deliver some smash hits but he has been on his rap side more recently (e.g. Scary Hours 2). I think it’s probably because his critics have been loud recently in saying the rap game has left him behind and is now in the hands of young guys like Lil Baby and DaBaby. I think he is trying to establish his presence amongst rap fans even more. This may be a prelude to CLB being more hit oriented and less rap, bar-heavy oriented. I really do think Drake cares a lot about public opinion and what is being said about him. He even admitted in the Rap Radar that he is insecure. I also think the pop market has changed a bit and that has changed his approach. I think him dropping a song with BTS or Dua Lipa or Ariana Grande might cost him a couple points “with the streets.” His relationship has changed with his regular pop collaborator, Rihanna (who has also been MIA in music), and he has always had a tense relationship with The Weeknd even though things seem to be on the upswing there.

,"""If I let you talk first, then no one talks second"" or whatever he said. So many quotables in this song. He completely washed Brent Faiyaz's boring dry ass. Halfway through DOATS verse I actually forgot that guy was on this song. Man, papi needs to stop giving classic records to these waste yutes. Anyways, I love how the beat doesn't sound super produced like No Guidance or most mainstream modern records. The toned down instrumental gives me Take Care vibes. That and Drake's run on flow where he talks about girls really adds to that feeling. I almost shed a tear listening to this song.

He also seems to have a habit of taking beats and editing them to his liking such as Back to Back and Sandras Rose. The beat Kanye gave him could've sounded much different by the time he was finished with it.

,"Well this has been discussed here often and I'll put it like this.

Did Drake lose the beef? Absolutely.

Did Drake lose the overall war? Fuck no.

2018 was huge for Drake and you could argue his name is forever tarnished as the guy who hid a child or whatever but there's honestly pictures of Drake with Adonis back in 2017. It's like no matter what Pusha says about Drake being a deadbeat, if the truth is that  Drake had actually accepted the child from the very beginning then Pusha's diss track loses a lot of power. It's like if your diss track is pretty much filled with speculation, you don't necessarily hold too much credibility. The only thing I feel like Pusha really got Drake with was the whole black face picture, even though Drake explained why he chose to do that, the reasoning in today's day and age still won't really fly and thus people will continue to bring that shit up to shit on Drake.

What I care about is longevity, to me if Pusha's diss track was so 'Lethal' how come it didn't end Drake? Lethal implies literally deading something for good. You can see Drake continue to thrive musically, and get number 1 hits etc.

Pusha didn't end Drake because the diss track never had anything of that caliber. He may have tarnished his name in certain conversations but that's pretty much about it. You can see Drake taking care of his kid, winning artist of the decade award, making great music and making lots of money. In my eyes he continue to win, while we don't hear much from Pusha unless he has something to do with Drake.",TheYorkGuy,1624924968,Drizzy

Here's the problem with that: what songs would you cut? Your favorite 15 songs and my favorite 15 songs are gonna be completely different. You hate Ratchet Happy Birthday? I love it. 

  
More importantly, the point of a double album is literally to be twice the length of a regular album and give the audience a high volume of music. Drake set out to make a sprawling double album in the vein of something like Biggie's Life After Death, and he did just that. Sure, I bet he enjoyed the extra streams he got from putting so many songs out, but unlike an album like Culture 2 which is just long for the sake of streams, I think Scorpion really does work as a double album and the structure makes sense. 

  
I could rant and rave all day about Scorpion. I've always loved it and always will. To me Side B is easily some of the best pop/r&amp;b of Drake's career. That plus the fact that both sides are absolutely loaded with hits AND all of the drama that surrounded it will always make it Drake's most compelling album to me.

  
Really I think people just saw how long it was and decided it was almost all filler. Which is disappointing because I firmly believe he was at the peak of his powers at one of the most interesting/dramatic points in his career, and the album displays that perfectly.",tc4050,1624844208,Drizzy

Lil pump has more monthly listeners than him which is fucking embarrassing. Homie can’t even run a fucking label properly. Ever since Kanye made him president of good music everyone been leaving it. Teanna taylor legit left cause of his poor management. Look at Drake in 2021, he balling, he rich as fuck, he known as the biggest artist alive, he’s artist of the decade.

On top of that, most of pusha’s disses just seemed a little below the belt. Like the one about 40 being sick… like he actually is sick and that’s kinda shitty to be making fun about how he likely will have a short life.

On top of all of this, the song really isn’t super catchy… idk. I think anyone who doesn’t really like drake just worships this song because it’s the only time anyone got close to getting shots in on him.",Zebaktu,1624818442,Drizzy

,"That’s not direct at all, could apply to anybody who people have been praising. As opposed to...

“If a nigga say my name he the hot shit
But if I say that nigga name he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don’t feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don’t know, but they should know
I just think it’s funny how they dangling the bait but I’m the one killin niggas wit the hooks tho”

Kendrick was the only relevant person that had said Drake’s name and baited him at that time, so it was clear who he was talkin about.",realityinternn,1624749908,Drizzy
,"It’s not a straight up diss track but There are some indirect bars thrown at Kendrick. When he says,”fuck any nigga that’s talkin that shit just to get a reaction, fuck going platinum I looked at my wrist and it’s already platinum.” And “I don’t know who you’re referring to, who is this nigga you heard about”. 

In those lines he’s referring to when Kendrick called him a pajama rapper or something like that on stage and then he seen Kendrick after and he said it was “all love”. He’s breaking down that Kendrick just did it for the crowd on some in the moment type shit. And Kendrick had talked about wanting to go platinum at the time. 

That’s why Kendrick even has that stupid song where he says something like,” been dissecting your motor mouth”. 

Then on Weston road flows he’s referring to the same thing. “You platinum like wrappers on Hershey boy that shit is worthless”.

I believe Sandras rose may have a Kendrick reference on it too when he says,” I walk in godly form amongst the mortal men”

Kendrick has a song called mortal man.

Also we talk about Not Around / Fair Trade a lot, rightfully so since it appears per Drake and his post/comments it’s album tracks but “Not Around” is a very high quality track.

If being critically acclaimed means music with less replay value then keep it.

The following weeks expose if the album was truly a success or not. It's already at #10 on the hot 200 in it's 5th week. The song streams in the following weeks after the debut are very poor and there's no hit song. Check Spotify for proof.

And his tour is selling out because he's J Cole. Drake dropped Scorpion and still did the biggest tour of his career.

,"Phase Inversion is when you get the official instrumental of a song along with its official audio and [put them side by side](https://imgur.com/a/UX33jz8) (perfectly- zoom in all the way to make sure the waveforms are symmetrical) [like this.](https://imgur.com/a/p77JKfg)  
You should also make sure the volume levels of both audio are as similar as possible, and then invert the phase of the official audio (there is usually a button for this in the DAW)  
\---  
Pretty good software is out there for making an acapella- the one I use is called PhonicMind; it's not free, but when you put an mp3 into the website, the AI splits the song into 4 pieces (Vocals, Bass, Drums and etc) and gives you a [sample of what the acapella will sound like](https://imgur.com/a/eYjmpsy). You download the sample it gives you for free and see if it fits your liking before spending (a small fee) for it. - I tend to use both techniques together as it has the best outcome, but it isn't necessary.",bzezzl,1624313068,Drizzy

,"Yeah that's true, I'm just of the opinion that like it doesn't matter. Like people get so worked up over Grammy decisions or like fantano reviews but like they literally don't matter. Like is it worth getting worked up about if some random person on the internet says they like macklemore more than Kendrick or drake or j cole? Imo nah they can like whatever they want. And I feel like Grammys are the same. It's just some ""committees"" opinion. They just frame themselves as being some legitimate authority on music but there's nothing special about them. You or I are capable of listening to music just as well as them. So like yeah you can criticise then. No one's beyond reproach. But imo criticizing them just pushes the narrative that they are some objective authority on music (or that they SHOULD be an objective authority on music when they do something like give macklemore a Grammy) , when music isn't objective at all. They're just some people with an opinion who try to convince others they're more than that with lots of theatrics",higuy5121,1624116060,Drizzy

,Bruh I know what 666 is. It's esoteric . It goes back to the worship of the pagan gods and saturnian worship. 6 represents the portal from physical to spiritual like dorthy in WOZ. 6 is also for the beast which is this deceptive sinful system we live under. 6 is also the planet of Saturn from the sun. They worship every component of ancient Babylonian pagan practices it's been in music since it's inception. The devil is just a term that means deceiver. Drake is a luciferian just like rhe rest.

People believe that Grammys are some sort of objective statement on music and that's why there's so much disappointment when they give it to someone like macklemore. But music isn't objective and anyone's opinion is just as valid as the Grammys. I think award shows in general just tap into people and artists insecurities about what's good or not and validating their opinions as if there's some objective right answer.

You know how little sense that makes? Firstly the confessing the sins part is confessing to Jesus, why would he confess to Ye lmfao. If he really did that implies he did it while they were married before 2018. Drake talked about how he felt betrayed by Ye and how friends don’t do that to each other. You don’t think Drake fucking Kim would be a betrayal? Wouldn’t what Kanye allegedly did be justified if Drake did that? Thus making Drake the “ snake” he claimed Ye to be. Use your brain bro.

,"People are dumb bro, especially Drake fans. He's an amazing artist but a lot of the details in his music go over people's heads. A popstar will attract the lowest common denominator of people. I don't even know why Drake writes deep lines anymore. He should just go full The Weeknd and write the most simplistic lyrics. People don't understand his subliminals at all except for rare fans like me and you.

Anyways, my interpretation of this line is that Drake is basically saying he fucked Kim K and that would be the sin that Kanye couldn't [believe.](https://believe.It) It's also ironic that Ye is all about Christianity these days and Drake says ""I got sins on my mind"". I was saying the same thing; why would Drake go from threatening Ye with the mafia and goons on songs like Toosie Slide, Mob Ties, or recently Only You freesyle to being friends with him again?",UnderpaidRedditSlave,1624029082,Drizzy

I sit alone at the park, bitterly listerining to NWTS. “How could he do this!?” I cried. It was months after the release of Views. I couldn’t believe it. Aubrey basically told me to go fuck myself with this album. I couldn’t believe he went full pop. 

Suddenly between sniffles one of my earbuds fall out of my ear. Except it didn’t fall, it was taken out. I look up. “Au-Aubrey?” He looked down at me with a solemn smile. A deep sigh left his chest, he looked into the distance for a moment to prepare himself. 

Without breaking his empathetic smile, he crouched next to me and wiped a tear off my cheek with his thumb. “You know, I understand why you’re upset but you need to understand something.” A puzzled look appeared on my face as I wondered what chapstick he was wearing (it was glossy). I tuned back into the conversation to hear what he had to say. 

“This album may be pop, but I promise if you give it a chance you’ll see that it’s pop made just for you.”

I began to cry. He stepped back and started singing to me “I should be downtown whipping on the way to you…” Making eye contact the entire time. 

Through tears and a shaky voice I crooned. “You got something that belongs to meeeeeahhheeee.”

,"🤦🏿‍♂️🤦🏿‍♂️Smh….I know it says studio album bro…the headline is still misleading cause he’s dropped 2 tapes and mad features in that time frame and the whole purpose of the headline is a “look how long it’s been since he’s dropped” premise.

And to the Kendrick point, he was on like 4-5 songs on that soundtrack and it came out in like 2018. If you’re using that to try and step on my point I guess it’s valid but not really cause since then what’s he dropped? And you’re making my point about the drake dropping music. I completely forgot about that soundtrack but we know a tape and several songs dropped on the last year from drake. 

My whole point is everyone’s overblowing the amount of time it’s been since drake dropped. He’s given us mad music while other artists have disappeared",Sw33tJvmes,1623966081,Drizzy

,"That reminds me I met Drake at a restaurant once - we’d accidentally been given his table. Apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked, and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong, (it was Tuesday and they thought he was coming on Thursday or something like that). Anyway, the manager, completely embarrassed (this is a pretty nice restaurant) comes by and says “I’m so sorry, but we’d like to move you to another table if you could be troubled, and we’ll gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal you’d like while you’re in town.” My sister and cousin were both like “Yeah that’s cool.” and I kind of played the asshole a bit. “I’m sorry, I just don’t understand. We’ve been here for 15 minutes - we’ve just ordered. Can’t we finish our meal here?” Then out of nowhere Drake shows up next to the manager and says “Paul, these guys can finish. We’ll be at the bar. I got some time.” And I (being a big Drake fan) said “Oh wow, uh… I had no idea. Please feel free to give them the table.” Drake was grateful, shook my hand and said thanks, then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later. After working up the nerve, I gave him a call that night, and to make a long story short, we had a glorious 11 month love affair, man on man, that I shall never forget. Our bodies intertwined as one, and from the beauty of Morocco, to the French Riviera, to the snorkeling in the Galopagos, Drake and I made glorious gay love to each other.",Neon__shark,1623965124,Drizzy

,"I saw Drake at a Loblaws in Brampton yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.  
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”  
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Okay?” but he kept cutting me off and going “Okay?! Okay?! Okay?!” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.  
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.  
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",EP40BestInDaLee,1623964154,Drizzy

,"Nah I wasn’t trying to argue bro, I just didn’t like how you said”stop the bullshit” or something like that lol but I’m not trippin, it’s all good. 

But to answer your question, I’ve been a pretty big drake fan since the start and I’ve listened to his projects thoroughly. And if drake never said it was a mixtape, I would personally still see it as different from an album just because if you thoroughly listen to an album like Views, you do find how each track blends into the next one pretty nice easily, especially u with me to feel no ways, the transition is pretty dope to me. Him and 40 really work on that with their albums like he stated.

If you’re reading this lacks that, don’t get me wrong I love the project and it’s one of my top fav drake projects for sure but it is just some tracks thrown together in reality. And like after track 12 it just randomly goes to singing with no proper transition and it gets kind of out of formation/organization as compared to his albums in my opinion as the project ends, but I still like all the songs on it. 

So I do see it as a mixtape still, yes. You’d just have to understand that his albums are more organized in that way though, so the songs match up with each other more so instead of being randomly put together. 

But that’s just me. 

More life seems to have better transitioning and way closer to a drake album but as it gets near the middle it gets kind of out of shape and there’s a lot of features kinda. 

Drake said after Views, he was just working on a lot of music and wanted to put something out and was working with other artists. He didn’t wanna wait hella long to put something out after Views like how other artist tend to do after they release an album. Hence more life came out",2mnypillsgiveuchills,1623876061,Drizzy

Traditional rollouts where you’re dropping 2 or 3 singles to get radio play and hype it up are pretty rare. And on a side note, one of the side effects of that that make me not like these rollouts are that by the time the album comes out those songs are usually a skip or a boring interlude because I’ve heard them so much. 

I loved Igor because yes it was a fantastic album but also because I got to hear the whole concept and story for the first time at once. Same with Mac Miller’s Circles. They announced good news and the albums release dates so I could avoid good news for a week to listen to the whole thing at once.

,"That's the info she gave me. She also told me about Lorde's single a week or two in advance, and it just dropped last week, so I definitely trust her. Knowing Drake, things could change in an instant, so he might choose to drop the single in the weekend like usual. But my source seems pretty set on the date. At Sony (where my source works), they have to plan around competition dropping music, and they are redirecting campaigns for other artists on the premise of Drake dropping on July 9, so it seems set it stone... unless he injures his other leg or something.",darkwarmed,1623726166,Drizzy

,"Right.. when my friend told me this, I had to make sure I heard her correctly. It's definitely against the grain of what Drake usually does, but it could potentially be due to a big artist dropping on the Friday of the week he plans to drop.

,"So this is just my opinion,obviously, but I feel like Drake is the missing member of the amigos kinda 😂 whenever he hops on a track with Migos there is obviously some chemistry and, it seems like Drake fits in pretty well with them…However I do feel like this song isn’t the greatest thing I have ever heard from them. 

Overall It’s not a bad song I think that it’s just that Drake is soooo famous and sooo like “pluggable” (if that makes any sense) into any genre or artist that he’s built this following of people who all like the diffrent versions/styles of Drake that he uses in his songs and features. So with that said it’s not surprising to me that there is a divide among Drake fans when it comes to certain songs. There are diffrent factions of Drake fans that are more a fan of one style over another. And I think that’s why he’s so famous and so worldwide, it’s because he doesn’t just always stick to the same sound. Doesn’t mean anyone is wrong or right about a song being “mid” it just proves that Drake can continue to innovate and evolve into whatever he needs too in order to fit the track. Just my 2 cents! Hopefully this makes just a little sense to anyone 😂",Hojo322,1623505978,Drizzy

People either thought the beef was deaded/going to be or he was talking about Kim for some strange reason. It’s a timing thing too. Isn’t it always convenient when Drake does something like this whenever Ye is back in the headlines? Especially in the past couple of days since it was Ye’s bday a few days ago and he was celebrating in France with his new girlfriend. Don’t believe the hype.

Btw.. Im forced to be given morphine for every project since 2012 as I'm not supposed to remember. 

You may remember a Young UK artist having songs with Mac Miller &amp; Jim Jones in short to having all my projects taken down and sold to the highest bidder so to speak. Although at this point I own most of my master's. 

Me and Drake go way back, I'll never give me full name etc but if you remember an UK artist 2011-13 being around then that was me. 

I'm still writing half the music out these days. Ain't a project I haven't been involved in. 

The music industry is shady as fuck. 

Could name a lot music of his and others I've been involved in but I'm technically still involved as we're all waiting for releases.

Any industry peeps here - hold tight The Sparrow Crew, Est 2004. 

Peace.",Alxxandxr3000,1623259569,Drizzy

,"Not sure if anyone here is a jayz fan but his loan appraisal docs were when the home was still being built and he references it a lot in “the Carter’s” album without anyone probably knowing.... the home was still being built when that album was made and released but almost completed. 
Some references are: 
Apeshit, Beyoncé says she bought jay a jet and their asset docs showed a plane

Lovehappy, jayz says he let Beyoncé write the will. She had her own separate will and in it i specifically remember her listing her designer dresses will go to blu ivy. She also says something about this on apeshit. There was no will on file for jayz though 

Boss, jayz says he has a 100 million dollar crib- this is true. The value was about $112 million and the loan balance was $50million

Off the top of my head he also referred at some point to his home being surround with water and they have an actual moat around their property LOL.... Beyoncé also says on one of the songs to come find her at her “compound, her fortress”

Jay references east/west direction on one of the songs and when I pulled up the map, the direction was accurate from their previous hidden hills property. 

I only mention all this because it’s cool af but jayz was one of the first to really tell a story of all the characters in his life and it’s what invested so many fans. Not just his mom but we know ty ty, Juan, etc. these references he makes helps us engage long term as a fan and drake does the exact same thing. 

Lastly, jayz has a $500K a year art allowance for his collection listed under assets.",ashkies,1623253619,Drizzy

,"No I’m not lying!! We had jayz and Beyoncé’s 50 million dollar mansion they had built a few years ago too. 

It was super cool to look at all their loan documents and assets. Drake had a 3rd party management company as the phone number to contact on his hidden hills property. But when I saw in the docs he really did acquire the property directly next door shortly before his song I was like oh wow literally everything he raps about is real. That’s when I actually gained real respect for him as an artist. Got to see the appraisal for the property and all the photos of the inside too. Really cool stuff. We had Eminem’s $8 million dollar mansion in Michigan, and I talked to his FA one day.... few NBA players, lots of business Moguals and CEOS. It was cool but the only personal info you really got access to was the property address. High net worth clients get to hide their socials, phone numbers, mailing addresses etc. and all of them have an assistant or financial firm as the management/point of contact.",ashkies,1623188081,Drizzy

,"You can’t really say that because there are people who view Views and Scorpion as better than NWTS or Take Care. It’s subjective. Personally I want CLB to sound like a better, more refined version of DLDT mixed with NWTS. 

It’s also my expectation. Because DLDT is the most recent gauge of what his current sound is like and his most recent project of music. But he has been working on this album a long time and I think it will be refined, concise like NWTS. But not necessarily ‘short’. I’m expecting an 18-20 track album that sounds like DLDT mixed with NWTS.",ysf02,1623186443,Drizzy

,"Backstory Behind Drake and Future's ""Diamonds Dancing""

Yet again, it was another late, sleepless night in Atlanta. The studio was packed, yet intimate all at the same time. Warm amber lights washed over exotic leather furniture, creating a dimly lit sonic oasis. A sweet aroma of weed smoke clouded the air, while vanilla scented candles were strategically placed around the room. The mood developed into a haze of relaxation. As engineers and producers methodically worked the mixing boards, Future and the rest of his entourage nodded along to a rough take of a track that would later be called ""Diamonds Dancing."" Many individuals in the studio danced along while producers ran the track back, but there stood Drake in a dark corner, dissecting every piece of ""Diamonds Dancing"" with surgical precision. The track stopped playing, and Drake stepped from the shadows. He didn't speak much, but when he did, people listened.

""I'm going back in the booth, play that outro back.""

Puzzled, the engineer began playing the outro instrumental back, not questioning Drake's demands. The room fell quiet as people began to observe. As the outro began to play, Drake put on a pair of monitor headphones, rubbed his beard and began to take a drink of a dark, murky substance. Closing his eyes, Drake began to flow freely.

""You doin' me dirty, you know. How we let it get like this I don't know. But that nigga can't save your soul, nah."" Producers and entourage members in the studio began to look around the room to see if others were witnessing what was happening. Drake continued crooning into the microphone, while the mood became even darker in the studio.

""Doing me dirty, you doing me dirty. Haven't even heard from you. How can you live with yourself? Haven't even heard from you. How can you live with yourself? Ungrateful, ungrateful."" The Engineer looked over to Future with concern. The engineer whispered, ""should we stop him?"" Future then put up one finger, as to silence the engineer while shaking his head, not taking his eyes off of Drake.

""Your momma be ashamed of you. I haven't even heard from you, not a single word from you, Ungrateful. I'm too good for you, too good for you. You should go back to him, perfect match for you, unstable."" Candles in the studio began to flicker and die out, one by one, as if a spirit swept throughout the room.

""Doing me dirty. You're making me nervous. I haven't even heard from you. You look drained, you look exhausted, girl them late nights ain't good for you. Really starting to show on you. Don't hit me up when it's good for you. Ungrateful."" By now, everyone had stopped what they were doing, all attention was focused on the darkened silhouette in the recording booth. Finishing up his final thoughts, Drake hung up the headphones, took another sip of muddy water, and crept out of the recording booth.

As he came back into the studio, all eyes followed his every movement. Drake retreated back to his shadowed corner, where he leaned against the wall with his fingers interlocked and pressed against his lips, as if in deep thought. The silence of the room created an uneasy tension. The uneasiness built more and more, as studio members waited for him to speak. Finally, he broke the silence.

I mean take the album’s intro as the first example. Keep The Family Close is in it’s own realm of Drake album intros. It sounds like nothing he’s done before when opening and setting the tone for an album. It’s completely different. It had to age, much like the album.

I didn’t like the song at first because it was so different I think, but it aged fine &amp; was the perfect intro for such a dark &amp; moody album. 

Vital is in the same realm of Keep The Family Close imo &amp; is different in sound. It’s one of my favorite leaks of his. It also means he is still experimenting which is great. I really hope that song makes it onto CLB.",anattractinganomaly,1623114406,Drizzy

,"Views because he fully dove into different genres instead of taking different aspects from genres he likes. On Take Care he had dancehall influence on the song Take Care but on Views he actually jumped on multiple beats that were closer to that culture. 

He also had songs where he jumped on southern and midwest beats of that time as well when he usually preferred east coast stuff when he wanted to flex his rapping prior to 2014. More Life is definitely his most “out there” work tho as far as experimentation goes.",tyd2120,1623076235,Drizzy

,"He doesn’t really do experimental albums, he’s more of a calculated approach kind of artist.

So far gone was experimental if anything with the rap and singing. Like he said, him and 40 didn’t know if it was gonna work out or not. I thought people had already done rap and singing projects though so.. 

After that it’d probably have to be what a time to be alive though I see you’re not including it. He said the project was presented to him already finished mostly or something like that. And he had to find his way on it and see if he could do justice. 

Views is somewhat experimental but it seems more of an artist pushing himself to make good songs that consist of his singing and what he can do as an individual artist.",2mnypillsgiveuchills,1623072401,Drizzy

,"CB is always a touchy ass topic on Reddit, it’s not that everyone forgave or forgot, but dude has worked with a who’s who in the industry since the incident happened. If people are mad in this sub when Drake is seen with dude they have to be mad when he’s seen with literally any other name in this culture 

When it comes to the incident itself... the relationship was toxic as fuck for a while before that night; they both absolutely got too physical with each other way before that night happened. Grabbed and scratched each other getting into petty arguments. Things finally came to a head in that car, with a dude who already grew up in an abusive household. Not justifying what he did at all, but it reached a boiling point over time. 

A lot of relationships get to that point, the sad topic is that plenty of men have put their hands on women amongst celebrities, but don’t get the treatment CB does to this day. He’s basically the face of it for the rest of his life pretty much.",_Wado3000,1623028455,Drizzy

,"## WARNING

### This is not a legitimate reddit user!

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *Scammer:* **Royal_Firefighter_54^^^New**
* *This Post:* [Drake, J Cole, Kendrick Lamar](https://old.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/ntu0w8/drake_j_cole_kendrick_lamar/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

---

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE &amp; AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

,"I was exactly were you are, really disliked drake bc of his popularity, ghost writers, too much singing, viewed him as soft, radio music, etc. 

But something happened and I started listening to all of him albums. All the reasons I disliked him started to become reasons to like him: his ridiculous ability to appeal to all audiences, capable of spitting nasty verses then sing a beautiful hook, staying true to his roots/no fake hard exterior, and his endless list of massive hits. Drake has the ability to craft moods and vibes perfectly, I can listen to him while getting ready to take on the world or be down in my feelings. 

He really is an incredible artist and deserves everything he has worked for. I’m grateful to be living in a time where I get to see/listen his greatness firsthand and watch his reign on the music industry continue to grow.

I think the reason people disliked it was because it’s a stark contrast from drakes previous project which was IYRTITL, which was a lot more grimy, not a lot of singing or pop songs on there, almost every track was straight rapping.

,"I know a lot of folks will disagree but as a huge Drake fan, Views to me is just okay, probably my least favorite of his albums. I liked that he did the dancehall/Afrobeat stuff on One Dance and Controlla and I wish he took it even further. Of course Feel No Ways is undeniably great as well.

Beyond that I find most of the album to be a lesser version of something else he's done. The trap songs pale in comparison to IYRTITL. The bars are nothing special to me and it felt like he didn't have much to say compared to how hungry he sounded on NWTS. The r&amp;b songs are good but again they're not beating anything on Take Care. 

I think the criticism it received when it dropped was mostly fair. I'm happy people have come to enjoy the album but if there's a Drake album I'd like to see people really come around to and appreciate it would actually be Scorpion. A double album stacked with hits, bars, and fantastic r&amp;b cuts in the midst of a huge rap beef, baby Mama drama and big-time breakups...just way more interesting to me than what was happening on Views.",tc4050,1622908422,Drizzy

Regardless, its one of my fav Drake albums because of the nostalgia it holds for me. Summer 16 was when I graduated HS and was a great summer overall. 

I remember bubbling a ting to controlla on the party bus going to prom, with other dance cuts like Too Good and  Childs Play. \*chefs kiss\* 

Then theres cuts like Weston Road Flows, Feel no ways, Fire &amp;Desire, Pop Style (wish it had the throne ft).

Its just that Drake has his own was of doing concept albums, he won't do it like J Cole's FHD or Kendrick's GKMC, but his album will be a concept in its own way. I feel that CLB will be just a little like that. It might cross between VIEWS &amp; NWTS (but obviously sound nothing like it), just have a feeling he'll be experimental like in those 2 albums while obviously still have some sounds from these new rappers cause that's what he always does (and I think it's for his streaming and popularity or whatever... he's a smart artist).",org73,1622875097,Drizzy

### This is not a legitimate reddit user!

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *Scammer:* **Fragrant-Solution-13^^^New**
* *This Post:* [Drake, J Cole, Kendrick Lamar](https://old.reddit.com/r/Drizzy/comments/nsf8pe/drake_j_cole_kendrick_lamar/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

---

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE &amp; AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

I do think drake wants to create something timeless and nothing like before. Music has changed rapidly throughout the year.
I also believe he has been perfecting it since 2020, the pandemic gave a lot of time to sit and breathe with creating a great product. 
I think he wakes up in the morning and listens to the album and changes it when songs don’t hit the same months later. No rush on a timeless piece. I mean I’m excited for CLB selfishly, but after he drops then what, it’s about how it will satisfy months after the drop, that’s more important than the drop itself.",Lifeof90,1622761265,Drizzy

3. For samples I really hope he samples and pays homage to a couple classic records like usual, preferably songs from the year 2000.

4. For production I would want producers like ovo40 of course, Majid Jordan, Metro Boomin, boi1da, nineteen85, tay keith, NAV, T- Minus, Timbaland, Dj Premier, Dj mustard, London on da track and Scott storch, again it’s a lot! But I would like to see a couple these producers I feel like it they would make the album different and maybe challenge drake to experiment with different type of beats!

,"I’m not saying your wrong, but I think the Grammy’s have lost some of their credibility where I don’t know if these guys really care that much. For example, The Weeknd had a #1 in three separate calendar years off the same album, blinding lights is top 5 all time in weeks at #1 and streams and all that shit. He performed at the super bowl and he literally did not even get a nomination for anything off after hours. Yet months later he basically won 23 awards from various shows in a matter of weeks. This the same guy who didn’t even get a single Grammy nomination for anything off the album. I get there’s more to what meets the eye from these artists, tying to review and album and come back and crush it. However I don’t think they are doing it for a Grammy.  I mean literally who had a better album or song or year in 2020-2021 than The Weeknd?

I kind of had a feeling that Kendrick was/is waiting for Drake to drop so he can check out CLB thoroughly and then try to put out something better. 

As I mentioned in my reply to someone’s comment on this thread already, Drake mentioned in his Views interview when referring to Tory Lanez((but this applies to other artist as well)) that someone will drop and then he will analyze their project and find what they “missed” and then he’ll make his own project and out do them. 

Feel like this is more than likely the situation here, but regardless I know Drake is gonna do mad streams. There’s just more competition now then there was then.

I don’t go through every lyric and be like “damn that’s a good ass metaphor, I don’t think Hov could’ve done that” now im not saying none of that matters but think about like basketball there’s a ton of things that matters. 69 for example I give him credit for making a song a ton of people want to listen to but when ranking he didn’t sound good to me.

There is a separation but people refuse to have that be the case in discussion with drake for some reason. It just makes no sense to me.

Your not comparing  music sales and a catchy hook when your comparing something jay vs nas, biggie vs pac, ja rule vs em, and hell drake vs push literally a perfect example. 

If your focusing on who “sounds better” as the final nail in coffin for who’s a better artist then that isn’t even the same discussion anymore fam. We ain’t confused we just are critical, and really love music lmao. I’m not gonna say 69 is a fucking phenomenal artist for blowing up commercially in gummo and equate that to quality worthy of being placed in a top 10 list.

,"“Drake is the hook king, very versatile although not the best lyricist” 

This my friend, this is exactly why the op stated  exactly that in the post. When sales are out of the picture thats kinda his point, that’s all there is in (his opinion) which doesn’t make you scratch the top 10 in hiphop. Hell he even said 2010’s meaning we’re talking section 80, GKMC, and TPAB. Being good at hooks isn’t something to scale in rap debate that’s more something u use to debate just flat out being a good “music” artist. 

That’s what I meant by thats not the convo cause it isn’t. Bringing in numbers means calling U, Mortal Man, or The Blavker the Berry worse than a lot of drake songs in a HIP HOP debate which is just not how you do that. Talent and commercial talent are two different things. Commercially drake is the fucking king...........talent wise tho? Top 10? When someone like fucking black thought exist? It’s just hard to agree to that man.

,"I do think there's a very convincing argument to be made that the most popular thing isn't always the best thing. i.e. Keeping Up With The Kardashians being popular does not make it a good show. Everyone wearing Nike doesn't mean it's the peak of fashion.. A president getting voted into office does not mean they are the best candidate for the job. Etc.

BUT I feel like it does have to play a role. You can argue that Drake isn't really even a rapper anymore, but his standout albums *Nothing* *Was* *The* *Same* and *Thank* *Me* *Later* are historically great Rap albums and could alone put him in the top ten of the 2010's, even if he more recently makes more R&amp;B and pop influenced music. Even Drake haters have songs off those two albums they bump to every now and then. *All* *Me* and *Wu-Tang* *Forever* made my Spotify top songs of 2020 for God's sake, and I'm not the biggest Drake fan in the world.

I feel like people be lying to themselves to not put him in the top 5, but he should be number 1. I mean who's his competition? Em is my favorite artist of all time but dropped the ball with TMMLP2 so hard I dunno if I can put him above Drake post-2010. Ye and Wayne dropped off hard (minus a few great tracks on *Tha* *Carter* *V*). The Weeknd isn't a rapper. Kendrick is hit or miss for me after *To* *Pimp* *A* *Butterfly*. Travis and J. Cole are the only people who even come close for me, and unfortunately J doesn't put enough out even though his releases always go hard. That just leaves Travis for me, and stylistically I think Drake is just better. I don't really see how you can put anyone I didn't mention above him, and I have a hard time arguing for anyone above Drizzy.

Drake puts out so much, and all his discography has a super high floor and astronomical ceiling. It's popular, and while it gets overplayed sometimes I don't think it ever gets old.

HOWGH, One Dance, God’s Plan, Hotline Bling, In Your Feelings all did huge numbers, probably the most individually Drake has for himself.

,"man.. Dre had released his 3rd studio album (the soundtrack) after 16 YEARS. The previous one was back in 1999, and since then, he has been teasing ""Detox"" as his next project, which has never dropped. On multiple occasions, people thought that it's coming, but apparently it didn't. The most remarkable thing, I guess, was that he released ""I Need A Doctor"" as a single and Kush followed the same pattern. Fast forward a few years, and we got the soundtrack of Straight Outta Compton. I have a feeling that if it hadn't been for this biopic movie, he would've never released another project till this day.

He just hopes that Drake won't do the same, more specifically announce stuff and never live up to his words",AirnessRaven,1622444391,Drizzy

,"Very true, and it's unfortunate because there are various connotations that come with that. One of which is the idea that if something is ultra mainstream and appeals to ""normies"", it's automatically seen as low quality. I enjoy a lot of more alternative and experimental music aswell, and people in those circles dismiss artists like Drake immediately because of reasons like this. Because he's loved by casual music listeners, they see him as low art and unworthy of any critical acclaim without truly giving him a chance and challenging their pre-conceptions.",RhombusKP,1622432507,Drizzy

,Idk if he does this as much as we think. I remember him posting a snippet of feel no ways on vine like a year before Views came out. I think Drake is a little more album conscious than just making a song in a night and putting it on the album. Remember in the rap radar interview where he said he was taking his time and not just in the studio constantly? That's more of what I think is happening. He's making music and then giving it some room to breathe before coming back to it. Then maybe he changes some stuff or expands on ideas but I doubt he's made like 30 new songs or something,Baritonal,1622395598,Drizzy

as an artist overall yes i think he would be in this conversation of 20. What it means to be an 'artist' has changed, before it was live instrumentation, a lot of dancing on stage and being blown away by raw talent. 

Now its a different kind of show where a fan comes on and takes a half court shot, equally great shows in their own right

His beef with Drake inspired him to write again and put out a 2018 album. The diss tracks were a good way to hype that up. It’s just good music business and it made sense. You don’t understand Pusha T and what goes on behind the scenes of the music industry. Go watch Pusha T’s 2018 interview with Genuis. The way Pusha T writes and what inspires him is different to other rappers, if he didn’t jump on it and take advantage of the Drake beef?
