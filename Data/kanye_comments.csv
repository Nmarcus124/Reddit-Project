16.0,16.0,"I think 808s is a great thematic Kanye album because he covers his struggles and arguments with whoever (Amber Rose I think) in songs like Paranoid and Robocop. He goes on to talk about struggling with getting back into meeting people in Streetlights which is by far one of Kanye’s best songs. The theme of heartbreak continues in Bad News and See You In My Nightmares at which Kanye reaches the point where he can let go. Followed up by Coldest Winter where he reminisces on the bad moments in the relationship and he accepts the fact that they won’t see each other anymore and hopes that he can be better in the future. And closing with Pinocchio Story where he reflects on how draining it is to be a celebrity and how no matter what things he can buy he can’t have the one he loves, but he will find his way.",IHaveNoEstus,1626804661,Kanye

They were the worlds first boy band.  That's about it.

Their popularity was/is because of the boomers.  

McCartney could have released complete trash and still sold albums.  He wrote some ok songs, if you like the beetles.
He could play the base.  

What else did he have besides massive popularity and name recognition that got anything he did tons of airtime on the radio and MTV?

 I can somewhat agree on Kanye being overrated but the man has put out a lot of really memorable tracks and atleast one mainstream banger on each of his albums. All falls down, gold digger, stronger, POWER, black skinhead, heartless, in Paris, Mercy.

Long story short: It’s my signature.

&gt;&lt;

Short story longer:

I was homeless once, a vagabond. I slept in my parents car. I couch surfed. During this time, I couldn’t afford a cellphone. I still needed one to get by.

I would borrow from friends/family or some times even strangers. It became really tedious, real quick, to always type:

“Hey this is actually, [Uchiha], using (insert name/kind stranger)‘s phone. So...”

And

“Okay. I am going to return this phone to it’s rightful owner.”

I wanted a symbol/logo/signature to type at the end of my texts so that people would know it was me w/o anything else. I thought about it for a while and got this, (+). It worked. In less than a week everyone I texted knew it was me.

I could type, “What’s my schedule (+).” And they know it’s me. I could finish with. “Peace (+).” And they know it’s me.

This went on for a while, almost 2 years.

When I finally was able to own my own cellphone, I would still type it out, out of habit. I knew then and there that I was on a fork-road. I could either train myself to not use it or keep it. I decided to keep it as a reminder of all the lessons I learned during this rough time in my life as well as my family’s life. Most importantly to remind me about the power of positive mindset.

I had no knowledge of the events leading up to it, such as the Taylor Swift incident, until after I listened to the entire album in one sitting.

I remember being in awe of the production and the overarching theme of the project. It was out of this world. That's when I became hooked and started to listen to all of his other albums. KSG was the second one I listened to after that, and it got me to listen to Kid Cudi etc etc. Life literally got better for me after that haha.

I do wish I was able to enjoy Kanye's older albums when they came out, but everyone's listening experiences are unique. I might be young (18 currently) but I genuinely do appreciate his art. :) Just my two cents.",special_unit_rosa99,1626756017,Kanye

1458.0,,"I don’t get why people think we aren’t allowed to critique modern trap flows. They’re just like anything: it can sound good or bad. It can be done well or poorly. When Frank Ocean does choppy style flows like that, like on RAF or In My Room, it sounds great. Vince Staples does those simple trap flows really well on his new album. JPEGMAFIA is another rapper [who can do that style great.](https://youtu.be/PO3mri47s7M) Playboi Carti is a master at short choppy flows that sound great. 

T-Shirt by Migos is the choppiest flow ever, but it’s an amazing song. 

Kanye’s choppy flows all over Jesus is King and this one just don’t sound good. They’re just lazy and bad. They don’t flow, and it’s called a flow for a reason. They just sound awkward and clash with the drums. 

And it’s not like he can’t do modern flows well, his verse on [Hurricane demo](https://youtu.be/k9BIc1kmUcc) over a trap beat is amazing. He’s just stopped trying sometimes.",SitDown_BeHumble,1626750389,Kanye

Let's all come together as a sub, and be the bigger fanbase. I do not like Kanye as a person, but we can also separate the man from the music. Whenever a Ye fan comes onto this sub that does not like Drake trying to tell us that Kanye's album is better than Drake's, we should just ignore it. After all, if mofos were confident in their artist, they would not have to be sliding in other artists' subs talking shit. At the end of the day, we can't keep hating Kanye for Drake - it takes too much out of us as fans when we should be fucking excited for CLB. I'm going to give Ye's album a shot simply because I love hip hop and all that comes with it, and I'm not going to say I dislike it and be petty just bc I do not like Ye.

The only track on TCD that feels bloated in any way is Last Call, and that’s mostly cause it’s Kanye doing a giant victory lap with his friends cause he just finished his first album. Without Last Call, TCD is the same length as MBDTF and has 10 more tracks total (AOTL interlude and WWSIA didn’t need to be separated), spreading out the runtime. This allows the individual tracks to rarely outstay their welcome, which I can’t say for MBDTF.",imepic26,1626744879,Kanye

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",OnyxOak,1626676458,Kanye

,,"Not cap. Sorry for the word vomit, here’s what i remember: 

Intro track is beautiful, they had a few kids from the church play the opening piano. I didn’t hear Tyler but apparently he’s on it. There’s at least 2 tracks with pusha, one of which they trade bar for bar for a few lines. Future on hurricane and another track with the same melody that probably transitions into it but he played them out of order. Lots of sampling his mom. Theres one random track that’s just his moms name repeated a ton of times for some reason, i thought it would transition into a hard drum beat but it didn’t really go anywhere.  There’s also a sad song about sticking with his family after the divorce which sounds right off 808s.  He skipped around and cut the audio at points, maybe he’s still making changes.  He didn’t play the Lauryn hill track. Didn’t hear any cudi.



Overall album sounds very heavy on the gospel but with synths. Be prepared for mostly slow songs and only a few bangers",wafflesandturtles,1626671250,Kanye

,,"Well my experience with Kanye was a little different. This is the internet and I know people lie on it, but bear with me cuz this shit actually happened. It's not copypasta.

My mom briefly dated Kanye's dad Ray in high school and they ended things on good terms. They even got back in touch a few years back after he figured out social media. They send each other family photos, swap work stories, and occasionally even Skype on holidays. One thanksgiving, I was over at my mom's and Kanye was visiting while they were skyping. His dad knows from my mom that I'm a huge fan and he offered to introduce us.

Well, Kanye would have none of it. First he pretended to not hear him while he awkwardly made excuses for him that he was busy preparing the turkey in the kitchen (we could see him right behind him  coloring with crayons or some shit), but then he rolled his eyes and said ""for fuck's sake"" loud enough for us to hear. He finally came over into full view and I shit you not, was wearing a bib and holding massive turkey legs in each of his hands. He didn't say a goddamn word. No hello or hi or even a smile. He just looked into the camera with dead eyes and just sucked the meat right off the turkey bones, one at a time, like a little kid sucking jelly off his fingers.",Mr__Awsm,1626669572,Kanye

,,"I met Kanye 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but Kanye fucking West himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I’m trying to quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother Kanye, but she wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Kanye put down his phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.",20mcgug,1626663577,Kanye

The man released hit after hit after hit, even if I personally don’t think the majority of his music is good. 

It’s not being a toxic Drake fan to be able to accept the man is extremely popular and well known.

Edit, from the wiki: 

The following week, partly due to the rising popularity of the dance challenge associated with the song,[24] it ascended to the top spot of the chart, becoming Drake's sixth number-one single on the chart.[25] On the issue dated July 28, 2018, ""In My Feelings"" broke the streaming record for the most streams in a single week with 116.2 million streams (later being broken by ""Old Town Road"" by Lil Nas X &amp; Billy Ray Cyrus on the week of April 13, 2019, which has the current record of 143 million streams[26]) and retained the top spot on the chart.[27] It remained on top for ten consecutive weeks until it was unseated by ""Girls Like You"" by Maroon 5 featuring Cardi B. It ultimately remained in the top ten for 14 weeks. It also reached number one on the Canadian Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.",SharpyTarpy,1626648541,Kanye

Middle eastern people descending directly from migrants of an Ancient Egypt would not look like that image of what is said to be Jesus. The perversion of his image is literally documented, why? Because it is important. It’s important when you have a massive population of stolen Africans worshipping a white “god”.

You are the type of guy that is always pessimist because you believe things that are obviously fake and you don't see them.

When a reliable source is telling me its happening I will believe it.

If you are on this sub and not on WestSubEver and probably not even on KTT2 how can you know whats real and whats not?

The album is almost finished and there is a huge chance it will be presented this thursday on the Mercedes Benz Arena on Atlanta (not confirmed tho).

If you don't believe me cool. Now don't talk to me about thinking critically because you clearly can't. You can't separate the different informations.

I am not sad. You are and you should look at yourself. You are telling people not to believe, not to be optimistic, not to be positive, not to be happy.

I feel like this happens because of how fast kanye evolves as an artist, by the time release date comes he's already exploring new sounds that he wants to incorporate into the project. That's why albums like TLOP have so much variety, it's a culmination of his musical growth over a couple years.

Instead of pumping out an album with the context of his current sound, risking it going stale, he'd rather continue developing various sounds and styles over time so he can return to each and pick out only what has stood the test of time",throwaway489597,1626583808,Kanye

tcd and lr is more classic hip-hop than mbdtf so i dont think its more accessible. maybe they were accessible when they came out but now they represent such a specific era in hip-hop that average listener wont care about. i agree with you on graduation though

Lyrically I think this is one of ye’s best album (obviously not the best) from saint Pablo, NMPILA, famous and more I think he puts in a lot of complex lyrics and metaphors. Plus the production is amazing , including one of the best gospels of all time, trap songs, a diss track, then multiple other stories such as NMPILA, wolves and saint Pablo.

B) Name one person, alive or Dead that can pull it off better than her. Go on, I'll wait.

Or... Bittersweet which is only an exclusive.

BUT

If I have to pick, I’d say Good Night. It’s such a beautiful song and I feel it fits with the theme and feeling of the album. I hated that both Good Night and Bittersweet are exclusives.

Additionally, I’d go with Good Night over Bittersweet Poetry because I listened to the live version and fell in love with the live version that the album version wasn’t as good.

But, Good Night that made me cry and I always feel like the “full version” aka the version I made on my computer thanks to limewire/Napster, I can play the album from the moment I wake up and drive home from work. I hear good morning. I hear Good Night.

Like I said, people have a tendency to forgive their abusers because they were mentally abused enough to still love that person. I’m sure Rihanna is a smart lady, but that doesn’t make her immune to the unfortunate pitfalls of the human mind.

At the end of the day, Rihanna is grown and can make her own decisions, but since most people agree that Chris Brown really fucked her up, isn’t it okay to worry about her? Basic human empathy doesn’t have shit to do with “white-knighting.”",TundieRice,1626396211,Kanye

You guys Stan the most problematic, fucked up artists known to man. Fiends, junkies with no clarity whatsoever and probably dudes worse than CB when the research is said and done.

Kodak has some serious rape and assault charges.

Tay K murdered someone. Someone older and more defenseless than him.

Dre has probably beaten women MMA style compared to Chris Brown.

I can keep going on. These are artists who people still listen to, take seriously and rarely cop shit for what they do or have done.

Chris Brown is a piece of complete shit for what he has done to Women, but at the end of it all, i come for the music, and I stay if it's good and leave if it's not.

So yeah, I’m gonna say attempted murder kind of trumps the whole “bad vibes” thing you mentioned. We all want Kanye to put his music out on time, but some of us also want him to show some improvement in character. 

Most other artists I would shrug off, but I actually want Kanye to be a good person because he used to actually want to change the world in a positive way. He brought hip-hop out of the gangster rap trend and into something more thoughtful, all while speaking truth to power. 

Maybe I’m naïve, but Ye’s music has brought me so much positivity in my life that I’m still always rooting for him to redeem himself morally, because it seems like his heart has always been in the right place, despite his brain fucking things up regularly. Dude has mental illness and hasn’t been the same since his mom passed. I totally forgive him for acting crazy, but it doesn’t mean I can’t hold him accountable.

This is real life, and it pissed a lot of people off. I know we all love Kanye, but we don’t have to justify his stupid actions. That should be a no-brainer.

With all the people being cancelled out here for stupid shit, Chris Brown’s career should’ve ended a long time ago, but he seems to coast by while continuing to be a violent piece of shit.

In terms of musical quality LR surpassed CD but a lot of people are going to put CD first because they remeber what the experience was like to hear something like that for the first time. 

I personally also really like the themes and message of CD and the way he opened up the album calling his shot that he was going to change rap and how he was going to do it was legendary. The first 7 songs of the album that he used to do that imo is the most iconic sequence ever on a rap CD and the album doesn't let up from there.",SirArthurDime,1626358481,Kanye

When you listen to Through the Wire and Last Call, it somehow leaves you with two entirely contradictory feelings: that Kanye West’s art was an inevitability, that it was somehow ordained and impossible to prevent from impacting so many people. And at the same time, it scares you to think how close the world came to never having the opportunity to experience his work at all. When I listen to Last Call I feel so much gratitude.

I mean, the man got evicted from his apartment in Chicago, and he and his mom moved to New Jersey, with Kanye later producing The Blueprint for Jay-Z. The fact that Kanye had the chance to lay his heart out on tape, along with the fact that he finally got the respect he deserved when he dropped his debut album in 2004, both go to show that ""Last Call"" is not only the best out of the three choices, but also the most **essential** because it gives an honest, transparent account of how Kanye became the man he is today.",redhotfunkadelic,1626070260,Kanye

12. cruel summer - couldn’t rlly care much less tbh 

11. wtt - i just rlly don’t like this guys im sorryyy, features were good tho 

10. jik - very underrated, great production and i think it’s thematically very good and consistent 

9. ye - good but very average for ye’s standards 

8. ksg - i can see why ppl love it to the level that they do but personally i only like 3 songs and ive never been a big cudi fan so it’s great but low on my list 

7. late registration - from here i adore every album, i just think this album is slightly too raw for me for such a long album, if it was cut down by three or four tracks it’d be much higher, songs like addiction and my way home aren’t bad at all they’re just unnecessary and make it slightly too long imo, hey mama is his second best song imo tho 

6. the college dropout - whilst this does have far lower lows than late registration the highs tend to be higher too, brilliant outro track, some of his best sampling and so much hunger 

5. 808s and heartbreak - so influential, street lights bad news and welcome to heartbreak are such a vibe, the outro is so emotional to me, it’s dragged down by the most overrated kanye intro, i hate the intro, would be flawless otherwise but probly wouldn’t change from being at number 5 tbf 

4. yeezus - the bad songs on this album are still very entertaining so they aren’t all that bad tbh, like i am a god and im in it, and the best songs are so fucking boundary pushing in the most beautiful way possible, new slaves outro and the whole of blood on the leaves blow me away every time

3. tlop - very flawed, the bad songs ruin it a very unnecessary amount but im not gonna negate anything from this, it’s a mess but it’s perfect, thematically his best work, features and samples are some of the best on one of his albums too, best outro track of all time, all genres, in my personal opinion, and by far his most interesting album to look into yk 

2. graduation - i honestly don’t think barry bonds is as terrible as ppl say, not his worst work it’s just a bit lazy, and drunk and hot girls is dumb yh but i quite like how he’s used the samples on that track, aside from big brother every other song is unbelievable in its brilliance, aged very well no matter what ppl might say and homecoming is a masterpiece 

mbdtf - greatest album ever made, thematically brilliant, more complex than meets the eye, bon iver features are always great but this is just a whole other level, every song is a showstopper, yh there are some dodgy one liners here and there that take it down from being a 10/10 but otherwise it’s amazing, my only real criticism is that it drains me to listen to it cos it’s so good, i could pass out when it ends",Bigting7,1626018745,Kanye

,,"Like I said man, there’s downsides, for health insurance I personally think we should do what Canada does, but as for college debt, there are so many different ways to avoid it.  There’s community colleges.  There’s private colleges that give out lots of money.  Do well in school to get that scholarship.  That’s what I did.  Take a gap year and work for money.  One of my friends did that.  Or, simply work hard in college to get a high paying job after and be able to pay the debt.  So many ways to solve that problem, just be smart and work hard.  Racial inequality is a problem and is there, sure, but it will eventually be solved.  So many people shit on this country and focus on the negatives.  How about the positives?  Why don’t I hear anyone talk about our freedom?  Would you rather live in a country where the government can kill you for practicing a religion?  And so many people died for us to have this.  People take what we have for granted and that’s a fact.  Maybe the people in this video were just being thankful for the millions who died.

,,"Yeah I’m not saying it has a bad track. Everything is well done and well performed. It’s not under baked and doesn’t outstay it’s welcome. I just don’t think the project as a whole holds up quite as well to Ye despite also being a spiritual successor of sorts. Ye feels much more like an evolution from the sound of TLOP, which is my favourite album of his so I may be biased.

The title track is cool, but doesn’t really capture my attention the same way a lot of tracks he made in 2018 do. Comparing it to anything off Daytona or Ye just makes it feel a little sleepier to me. Again, I enjoy the track, by no means is it bad. I just think it doesn’t do enough to grab my attention while among tracks like Feel The Love, 4th Dimension, or Freeee. I can say the same thing about Cudi Montage, but I like that song more. The guitar sample is great, and I find the atmosphere it provides is a lot cooler than the title track. I’m just not quite as in love with the track as a lot of people are. I think it definitely works great as a closer but it doesn’t hit me as hard as something like Violent Crimes. I do think it’s a better closer than Infrared off Daytona, but I think Daytona is just a stronger project overall.",imepic26,1625718013,Kanye

It’s probably cause I’m a much bigger fan of Kanye than I am of Cudi, but I think the last two tracks just aren’t quite as good as the rest of the album, and on an already short project that kinda takes away from it more than I would like. I think it’s definitely well made, and a fun listen, but compared to Ye it just doesn’t do it for me in the same kind of way.

Ye's whole thing with this shoe was from seed to sole, he has control of the entire process which means higher costs, cause he's not taking advantage of people the way fast fashion often does.

I love that they look abnormal, what makes them exciting to me is that they look unusual. And it's hard to explain cause I'm not familiar with the correct fashion vocabulary, but the outfit that he is wearing, the way that his jacket is so broad and his trousers are also wide leg, the foam  shoes add a volume at the bottom of his outfit that ties it all together.

,,"Ye is my favorite album from the African American individual Kanye West, known for this production, rapping, and ventures into Fashion. He has been influential in the 21st-century development of mainstream hip hop, popular music, and popular culture in general. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained notoriety as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several mainstream artists. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He experimented with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism, respectively, West's fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also critical successes.",AppleKing808,1625653638,Kanye

don't act like you don't know of the extreme hate waves for albums: ye, yeezus, WLR, TESTING. go to any big rap page comment sections about these albums, there will be a lot of people saying ""(X) was mid"" with nothing to back up what they are saying. Twitter or not it happens

you want to talk about empathy? how about some empathy for the thousands, millions of lives lost in countries invaded by the US ostensibly in the name of of the free world and democracy? All that suffering, and most Americans don’t give a shit about it, and sing their national anthem in a fucking wal mart of all places, surrounded by consumer goods available to them due to the exploitation of poor people and the global south.

Like, the original video of this is so tone deaf and creepy, unless you unquestionably believe in the same things everyone in the video does. I get that the people in this video all buy into the idea of american exceptionalism and all that, and it’s not really their fault. How do you question something that is so ingrained into you? But the comparison to the Nazis, while pretty common and even tired, isn’t invalid. Everyone from the most extreme Nazi to a more politically “moderate” German would have done or at least been ok with similar things in their time. 

The US is so politically far to the right that idk what the correct solution is to wake people up to how fucking weird this behavior is, but the solution is certainly not to shut up and pretend that these things aren’t fascistic!!

,,"Kanye has sort of a mysterious element to him.  
He has cryptic messages, he doesn't often make public appearances or announce where he is going or his plans,  
and when he does he could be wearing a face mask that covers his entire head.  
In this way there's more suspense about being in his presence, like he's a rare creature being sighted.  
It means that when he just appears at a concert people lose their shit.  
I wouldn't be surprised if he learnt from what Michael Jackson did, where he can just appear at a concert, stand still for 2 minutes, take his shades off and the whole crowd's going crazy throughout.",WeetabixFanClub,1625512694,Kanye

but most of it I find boring.  I like the flow Kanye has when on the chorus and when the flow on the rhyme scheme

 ""I cant explain it I surprise myself too"" but other than that the Kanye verse is just okay.

 And I don't like lil Wayne's voice or verse on the song. Usually his voice doesn't bother me but the flow with the best with the voice just doesn't blend well in my opinion and sounds really awkward. maybe if his voice was a little brighter and playful it would sound better but Im not sure

Feel The Love is a great song, really like Cudi on here but the only thing I dislike are the gun sounds Kanye makes, it definitely adds something to the track though. Fire is maybe the most 'meh' song on there, the guitar bit at the end is amazing. I get goosebumps when the beat drops on 4th dimension and they both go so hard on it, has to be my favorite. Freeee is a great sequel to Ghost Town which I already liked. Reborn is the best chill/relax type song, Kanye great verse too.

It’s also like people are like “bro don’t buy dmt, dmt finds you” and a few people I’ve met have said they would smoke me up with some but none of them ended up working out for one reason or another. 

Either way, lots of popular rappers do psychedelics. There are psychic constructs and energy manipulation via sound and subliminal messaging in the realm of psychosis, and not just for me, that causes it to be an easy idea to slip into the mindset of it being true; which it might be. It’s easy to theorize conspiracies about psychedelic use in the hip-hop industry. Like how old heads talk about the hip-hop Illuminati (look it up fr, it’s popular, even joked about in the Cleveland Show!) 

But that was just some sacred esoteric knowledge for you lol. When I say stuff about subliminal messaging usually it makes sense, and it also seems like who is saying these things, why am I saying these things type deal. But I’m also like yo if this is legit this is cool. But I think I have an entire universe simulated in my mind (like how you dream) and I basically attribute all this weird stuff to my universe that exists completely mentally. And because it doesn’t follow the laws of physics, when I’m in it or remember being in it I think I am a god or that I’m friends with Kanye. Like an astral realm type deal I suppose. But the theory is that that’s why my delusions happen. When I conflate the two realities. 

But honestly who knows.",timmythenpc,1625209600,Kanye
